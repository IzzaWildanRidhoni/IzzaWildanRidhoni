My name is Izza Wildan Ridhoni, and I am an undergraduate informatics student at IST AKPRIND Yogyakarta. My interest lies in web development, and I have experience as an Operating Systems practicum assistant, Introduction to Information Technology and Data Structures. In addition to my academic and technical expertise, I am actively involved in various committees especially at the martyr mosque. I have served as media coordinator, CERAH coordinator, Sacrifice Acceptance Coordinator and Chair of the Ramadhan 1444H Committee. These roles have honed my leadership, communication and teamwork skills.

I am highly motivated, results oriented and have a strong work ethic. Plus, I'm a collaborative team player, always open to learning new concepts. With my skills and experience, I am confident to become a valuable asset for any team. I want to start my career in the technology industry, looking for a position where I can leverage my knowledge and skills to create a positive impact.</p>
